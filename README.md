## What is This Project?

This is **Mahdi Hoseini's** professional CV and cover letter, built using the **Awesome CV** LaTeX template. The template is inspired by [Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv) and provides a clean, semantic markup that's easy to customize.

### Features
- **Professional Design**: Clean and modern layout
- **LaTeX Powered**: High-quality PDF output
- **Customizable**: Easy to modify colors, fonts, and content
- **Version Controlled**: All changes tracked with Git
- **CI/CD Ready**: Automated PDF generation with GitHub Actions


## Quick Start

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build resume
make resume.pdf

# Build cover letter
make coverletter.pdf

# Build everything
make examples

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

### Requirements

A full TeX distribution is required. [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) is recommended.

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install --cask mactex
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install texlive-full
```

### Docker Alternative

If you don't want to install TeX locally:

```bash
docker run --rm --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -i -w "/doc" -v "$PWD":/doc texlive/texlive:latest make
```

In either case, this should result in the creation of ``{your-cv}.pdf``
